<h2>History</h2>
<p><em>The first known humans in the region of Kyiv lived there in the late paleolithic period (Stone Age).[67] The population around Kyiv during the Bronze Age formed part of the so-called Trypillian culture, as evidenced by artifacts from that culture found in the area.[68] During the early Iron Age certain tribes settled around Kyiv that practiced land cultivation, husbandry and trading with the Scythians and ancient states of the northern Black Sea coast.[67] Findings of Roman coins of the 2nd to the 4th centuries suggest trade relations with the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire.[67] The people of the Zarubintsy culture are considered the direct ancestors of the ancient Slavs who later established Kyiv.[67] Notable archaeologists of the area around Kyiv include Vikentiy Khvoyka.</em></p>
